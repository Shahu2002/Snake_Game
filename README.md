# Snake_Game
The Snake Game is built using the Swing library, which provides components and utilities for creating graphical user interfaces in Java. The JFrame class is used to create the game window, and various Swing components like JPanel, JButton, and JLabel are used to create the game screen, buttons, and score display.
It is a simple Java 2D Snake game. The game is implemented using JAVA AWT, Swing, ActionListner and KeyEvent.
Objective of Game:
Snake is an older classic video game. In this game the player controls a snake. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. Each time the snake eats an apple its body grows. The snake must avoid the border and its own body.
Development of Java Snake game:
Each dot of the snake is 10 px in size. The snake is controlled with the arrow keys. Initially the snake has three dots. As the snake eats apples, the dots increase in size and the score goes up. If the snake hits the boundary and the body, the game is over and if the game is over, the "game over", "Score" and "press space to restart the game" message is displayed in the middle of the board.
Features:
Simple and intuitive controls.
Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
Game over screen with the option to restart the game.
Sound effects for eating food and colliding with obstacles.
Requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

STARTGAME

How to run the project:
Run the Main class to start the game.

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right. The game will automatically restart once the snake collides with an obstacle.

Start playing with the arrows keys.

If the snake collides with the board and its own body, it is game over. If game is over, press space to restart or just close it and run it again.
